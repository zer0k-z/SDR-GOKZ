#pragma once
// Interface header for SVR.
// Don't use internal headers here such as svr_common, or internal type aliases, as this header should be easily distributed.
// This header is used by SVR standalone and by the Momentum integration.

// How this should be used:
// 1) At startup, compare the return value of svr_api_version with SVR_API_VERSION and continue if the versions match.
//    If the versions do not match then SVR cannot be used.
// 2) Call svr_init at an appropriate location to initialize SVR once.
// 3) Call svr_start when movie production should start.
// 4a) Call svr_frame for all frames where movie production is active.
// 4b) Optionally call svr_give_velocity before svr_frame.
// 5) Call svr_stop when movie production should stop.

// Programming errors are printed to the debugger output (prefixed with "SVR (<function name>):").
// User or system errors will print messages to SVR_LOG.txt (for standalone SVR) and/or to the game console (if available at the time of error).
// All functions in this API must be called from the game main thread only.

// Windows only.

// For standalone SVR, this will be the path to where SVR is installed on the system.
// For integrated SVR, this will be the path to where SVR is located for the game (probably in a folder next to the executable).

// The allowed extensions (media containers) for the H264 video stream is one of the following: mp4, mkv, mov.
// Starting the movie will fail if the container is not one of these. AVI is not supported as it's a very outdated

// *) fps_max should be set to 0 to not introduce any extra latency between frames.

// *) engine_no_focus_sleep should be set to 0 to allow the game not being in focus while processing.
// *) volume should be set to 0 for it to not be annoying.
